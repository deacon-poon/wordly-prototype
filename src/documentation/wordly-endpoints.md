Workspaces Feature Implementation
The goal of the Workspaces feature is to create a structural feature that enables admins in larger organizations to manage multiple users and enhance team collaboration through shared access to objectsâ€”including minutes, sessions, glossaries, and transcripts. This enhancement will improve service for existing clients while positioning the company for enterprise growth.
Workspace Structure
A Workspace is an organizational container that allows organizations to manage multiple users, resources (sessions, transcripts, glossaries, minutes) and settings (session defaults, custom fields) within a single unified environment. It serves as the primary structure for:

Managing team members with different permission levels (Admins, Editors, and Viewers)
Organizing and sharing resources (sessions, transcripts, glossaries, minutes) across teams
Configuring workspace-specific settings such as custom fields and session defaults

Workspace Implementation Considerations

API Endpoints to Extend:

New endpoints will be needed for workspace management
Existing endpoints should be modified to include workspace context

Permissions Model:
The core permissions matrix includes:
NameAdminEditorViewerSessionsEditEditViewPurchase minutesEditNo AccessNo AccessGlossariesEditEditViewTranscriptsEditEditNo AccessCustom FieldsEditViewViewSession DefaultsEditViewViewAccountEditViewViewUsersEditViewViewActivityViewViewViewTransactionsViewNo AccessNo AccessClone WorkspaceEditNo AccessNo Access

Resource Ownership:

All user objects (except Accounts) will be moved into a default workspace called "My Workspace"
Accounts will become owned by the Organization
Glossaries will become owned by the My Workspace of the user who created them
Any objects created under a new workspace will belong to that workspace

Design Recommendations for Prototype App
Based on the API capabilities and the upcoming Workspaces feature, here are recommendations for designing a prototype app:

1. Authentication & User Flow

Implement a login and registration system
Create a workspace selector in the navigation
Support for SSO integration

2. Core Navigation Structure

Dashboard with usage statistics and recent sessions
Sessions/Presentations management
Glossary management
Transcript access and management
Account and billing
User and workspace management (for admins)

3. Presentation Creation and Management

Wizard-based session creation
Language selection interface
Integration with meeting platforms
QR code generation for attendee access

4. Real-time Translation Interface

Captioning display with language selection
Audio playback controls
Transcript viewing and downloading

5. Workspace Management Interface

Create/edit workspaces
User permission management
Resource sharing between workspaces
Activity tracking and logging

6. Migration Considerations
   When implementing the workspace feature, consider:

All user objects (except Accounts) will be moved into a default workspace called "My Workspace"
Accounts will become owned by the Organization
Glossaries will become owned by the My Workspace of the user who created them
Any objects created under a new workspace will belong to that workspace

Technical Implementation Notes

API Interaction:

All API endpoints accept and return JSON
Authentication is handled via tokens
Error handling should accommodate the standard error response format

Real-time Functionality:

Sessions and presentations likely use WebSockets for real-time updates
Audio streaming requires specific handling for low-latency delivery

Security Considerations:

Implement end-to-end encryption
Support SOC 2 Type II compliance requirements
No use of customer data to train speech recognition or translation models
Customer ownership and control of all data
Regular third-party penetration testing
Static analysis security tooling
Vulnerability scanning
