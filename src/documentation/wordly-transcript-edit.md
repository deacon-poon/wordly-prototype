# Transcript Editing Feature Specification

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Users frequently need to edit transcript text for accuracy and have those edits automatically sync with translations. This is particularly critical for users who download SRT/VTT transcripts for video subtitles, where accuracy and proper formatting are essential for accessibility and professional use.

### Current Limitations

- No editing capabilities for generated transcripts
- Users cannot correct transcription errors or improve accuracy
- Downloaded SRT/VTT files contain unedited transcription mistakes
- Speaker tags from disambiguation cannot be modified
- No mechanism to preserve edits across translations

### Solution Goals

Provide users with intuitive transcript editing capabilities that:

- Allow correction of transcription errors
- Maintain synchronization across all language translations
- Support speaker tag modifications
- Preserve timing and formatting for subtitle export
- Integrate seamlessly with existing transcript workflow

## Core Features

### 1. Text Content Editing

#### Approach A: Full Text Editor

**Description**: Add edit button that opens comprehensive text editor window

**Advantages**:

- Efficient for extensive edits across long transcripts
- Familiar interface for users accustomed to document editing
- Supports bulk find-and-replace operations
- Better for major content restructuring

**Disadvantages**:

- Risk of users making drastic changes affecting layout/timing
- Potential loss of timestamp synchronization
- Less granular control over specific segments

**Implementation Considerations**:

- Rich text editor with transcript-specific formatting
- Preservation of timing markers during edits
- Warning system for major structural changes
- Auto-save functionality to prevent data loss

#### Approach B: Inline Bubble Editing

**Description**: Allow users to edit individual text segments/bubbles directly

**Advantages**:

- Precise, surgical editing approach
- Maintains clear segment boundaries
- Preserves timing synchronization naturally
- Lower risk of structural damage to transcript

**Disadvantages**:

- More cumbersome for extensive edits
- Requires more complex UI development
- May feel limiting for users needing bulk changes

**Implementation Considerations**:

- Click-to-edit functionality on text segments
- Visual indicators for edited content
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation between segments
- Undo/redo functionality per segment

### 2. Speaker Tag Editing

**Requirements**:

- Edit speaker names assigned through speaker disambiguation
- Support for adding new speaker identifications
- Bulk speaker name changes across transcript
- Visual distinction between automated and manually edited tags

**Features**:

- Click-to-edit speaker labels
- Speaker management panel for consistent naming
- Automatic propagation of speaker name changes throughout transcript
- Option to apply speaker changes to related transcripts

### 3. Translation Synchronization

**Core Functionality**:

- Automatic propagation of edits to all existing translations
- Smart handling of language-specific formatting
- Preservation of translation quality while incorporating edits
- Conflict resolution for content that doesn't translate directly

**Technical Approach**:

- Edit tracking at segment level
- Re-translation triggering for modified segments
- Version control for edit history
- Rollback capabilities for problematic changes
